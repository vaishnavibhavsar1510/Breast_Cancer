Abstract:-
Ongoing breast cancer research is vital due to its global impact. AI, particularly GANs, offers new avenues. This framework employs GANs to create synthetic images of various cancer stages, facilitating tracking and treatment insights. Medical-machine learning collaboration is key. Ethical adherence, patient privacy, and accurate data shape the GAN training. Synthetic images offer progression insights, aiding biomarker discovery. Challenges include clinical applicability, needing medical input and regulatory approval before use.

Problem Satement:-
In cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, breast cancer accounts for 25% to 32% of all female cancers, more than 1/4th of all female cancers.
Almost 50% of all cases are in the age group of 25-50. And more than 70% of the cases present in the advanced stage had poor survival and high mortality. The Indian Council for Medical Research recently published a report which stated that in 2016 the total number of new cancer cases is expected to be about 14.5 lakhs. This figure will likely increase to 17.3 lakhs in 2020.

Solution:-
An intriguing application of AI and healthcare is the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to examine breast cancer development dynamics for novel therapy discoveries.  
A generative AI solution for breast cancer offers transformative potential by enabling early detection of subtle patterns in medical images, expediting diagnosis and interventions. Personalized treatment plans, driven by patient history and genetics, optimize outcomes while reducing side effects.
